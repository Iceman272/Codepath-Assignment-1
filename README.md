### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The web link for the superhero grid constantly did not work. I spent hours trying to fix non existant problems all caused by the weblink. One of my professors even mentioned how I had done everything correct and he did not know why it was not working. I also had problems using my gif on discord. Ikept having to reedit the gif because it was too long to be shown on github. I am submitting late because of these problems.
